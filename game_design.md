This game is meant to be a simplified 3D Golf Game.

The user will be the ball. THe camera will lag the ball and indicate aim direction. The surface will be a 3D generated landscape using perlin noise. The player/ball will jump towards a target cube on the landscape. When it gets it, a new one will spawn in the distance. It should repeat this gameplay loop into infinity.

During development, the game will run on a 10 second timer to collect logs and see the output.
